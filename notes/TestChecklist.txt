* License
Entering valid license works
Trial: A file in the git repo from the future should cause debase to assume the future date of the file
Trial license is deleted upon expiration
Too many machine ids prevents registration
Starting a trial after it's expired doesn't work
Server doesn't send trial license if it's expired
A mismatched machine id triggers a license renewal
Valid license still works after 2 weeks (ensures that trial logic isn't interfering)
Incorrect email prevents registration
Incorrect license code prevents registration
Corrupting the license on disk is detected because the signature is wrong

* Server
Stress test server by hitting it with lots of requests simultaneously

* Privacy
No network IO occurs on first launch, until a button is clicked
Machine ID isn't calculated on first launch until a button is clicked
