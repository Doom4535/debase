Trial: A file in the git repo from the future should cause debase to assume the future date of the file
Trial license is deleted upon expiration
Too many machine ids prevents registration
Starting a trial after it's expired doesn't work
Server doesn't send trial license if it's expired
A mismatched machine id triggers a license renewal, renewal succeeds silently if there is a machine slot available
A mismatched machine id triggers a license renewal, renewal fails and shows dialog fails if no machine slots available
A mismatched machine id + no internet shows renewal dialog after 5s
A mismatched machine id + stalled internet (ie Network::Request() takes a long time) shows renewal dialog after 5s
Valid license still works after 2 weeks (ensures that trial logic isn't interfering)
Incorrect email prevents registration
Incorrect license code prevents registration
Corrupting the license on disk is detected because the signature is wrong
Make sure MachineInfo is properly sent to the server
