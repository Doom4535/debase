* Licensing flow

    SealedLicense empty?
        yes && expired==0 -> show welcome panel
        yes && expired==1 -> show register panel with custom message ("trial expired")
        no -> _LicenseUnseal()
            success -> done (debase is registered)
            invalid machine id && !trial -> renew license
                *** problem -- what if network IO stalls at this point?
                *** user is able to use debase effectively unlicensed during this time.
                *** however, our machine-id scheme isn't perfect, and the machine-id
                *** could change over time. in such a case, we don't want to burden
                *** paying customers by showing the register panel again.
                *** compromise: refresh in the background with a 10-second timeout.
                success -> done (debase is registered)
                timeout / network error -> show modal error panel with retry button ("debase license isn't valid for this machine, but debase couldn't reach its server to renew it")
                server error -> show register panel with server error message
            expired -> delete license, set expired=1, show register panel with custom message ("trial expired")
            error -> delete license, show welcome panel
